In JavaScript, there's no need to explicitly convert a number to a float,
 as JavaScript already uses floating-point representation for numbers.
  When you work with numeric values in JavaScript, 
  they are typically stored as 64-bit floating-point numbers (often referred to as double-precision floating-point numbers).
 This means that even if you start with an integer, it's internally represented as a float.

console.log(1 + 2 + "2")  /*= 32*/
